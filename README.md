# Namaste React ðŸš€

## Introduction

This project leverages the **Parcel** bundler for efficient builds and introduces a structured approach to building a scalable React application named **Namaste Food**. It explores concepts like React Hooks, Redux Toolkit, and modern testing practices to create a robust web application.

---

## Parcel Features

Parcel is a powerful bundler with several built-in features that make development faster and easier:

-   **Dev Build**: Automatically builds files for development.
-   **Local Server**: Includes a development server for real-time feedback.
-   **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**: Automatically updates modules in the browser without refreshing.
-   **File Watching Algorithm**: Written in C++ for high performance.
-   **Caching**: Speeds up rebuilds by caching processed files.
-   **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimizes images for faster loading.
-   **Minification**: Reduces file sizes for production.
-   **Bundling**: Combines multiple files into a single optimized output.
-   **Compression**: Reduces the size of bundled files.
-   **Consistent Hashing**: Ensures consistent filenames for caching.
-   **Code Splitting**: Splits code into smaller chunks for optimized loading.
-   **Differential Bundling**: Provides support for older browsers.
-   **Diagnostic**: Helps identify and debug issues during development.
-   **Error Handling**: Simplifies error detection.
-   **HTTPS Support**: Easily configure HTTPS for local development.
-   **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused code from the final bundle.
-   **Different Dev and Prod Bundles**: Automatically generates separate bundles for development and production environments.

# 1. Export and Import in JavaScript

## 1.1 Default Export/Import

```javascript
// Export
export default Component;
// Import
import Component from "path";
```

## 1.2 Named Export/Import

```javascript
    // Export
    export const Component;
    // Import
    import { Component } from "path";
```

## 2. React Hooks
    - React Hooks are powerful utility functions in React:
        1. useState(): For managing state variables in React.
        2. useEffect(): For handling side effects in functional components.

## 3. Web App Routing
    - Two types of routing commonly used in web applications:
        1. Client-Side Routing: Routes are handled on the client-side for a seamless user experience.
        2. Server-Side Routing: Routes are handled by the server, often requiring page reloads.

## 4. Redux Toolkit
    - Redux Toolkit simplifies state management in React applications:

    4.1 Steps to Set Up Redux Toolkit
        1. Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux.
        2. Build a Store: Centralized state management.
        3. Connect Store to App: Use <Provider> to connect the store.
        4. Create Slices: Define slices of the state (e.g., cartSlice).
        5. Dispatch Actions: Trigger state updates using dispatch(action).
        6. Selectors: Extract specific pieces of state.

5. Testing in React
    5.1 Types of Testing
        1. Unit Testing: Test individual components or functions.
        2. Integration Testing: Test how components interact with each other.
        3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Simulate user interactions and test the entire app workflow.

    5.2 Setting Up Testing
        1. Install React Testing Library: Provides utilities for testing React components.
        2. Install Jest: JavaScript testing framework.
        3. Install Babel Dependencies: Required for JSX and ES6+ support.
        4. Configure Babel: Add presets and plugins for JSX.
        5. Disable Parcel Default Babel Transpilation: Update the Parcel config file.
        6. Jest Initialization: Run npx jest --init to set up Jest.
        7. Install jsdom: Simulate a DOM environment in Node.js.
        8. Install @babel/preset-react: Make JSX work in test cases.
        9. Update Babel Config: Add @babel/preset-react in your Babel configuration.
        10. Install @testing-library/jest-dom: Extend Jest with custom matchers for the DOM.

6. Conclusion
    This project serves as a comprehensive guide to building modern React applications with advanced tooling and best practices. Explore the features, learn the structure, and use the outlined steps to set up efficient testing environments.

  Reconciliation (Overall process to update the DOM)
      |
      |-- React Fiber (Manages scheduling and prioritization of updates)
      |   |
      |   |-- Diffing Algorithm (Compares old and new virtual DOMs to find changes)
      |
      |-- DOM Update (Applies changes to the real DOM)

  Explanation:
      Reconciliation: The parent process that determines how to update the UI efficiently.
      React Fiber: A system within reconciliation that splits the work into manageable chunks and prioritizes it.
      Diffing Algorithm: A component of Fiber that identifies changes between the old and new virtual DOM.
      DOM Update: The final result where the necessary changes are applied to the actual DOM.
```
